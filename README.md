This repository contains the Alphafold PDB files for MLRR1_PLAF7 protein from Plasmodium falciparum. 
Protein length is approx ~10,000 residues and does not have any crystallographic or full-length predicted models. 
This is an attempt to model the full structure, N-terminal to C-terminal in small chunks or chains. The sequence overlaps at the terminals by 200 residues. Delete those repetitive residues and concatenate using the UCSF-Chimera or Pymol. Lots of spaghetti regions can be observed between the secondary structures. It might reduce the structure prediction confidence score.
